This was made in a botched attempt to create a video that could be the longest video on YouTube.  It generated every color in the
RGB color space, one at a time, and rendered them out to a saved jpg, numbered so they could be played in order.  As you might
guess, Adobe Premiere doesn't like having 17 million files being jammed into it at once, so the 3 days this took to run was wasted.
