This was a project done for my Film 20C class at UCSC.  It is a giant eyeball that flies around and chases after a stick figure.  The
stick figure runs away, following the mouse.  Clicking causes the eye to fire a projectile that chases the person, who jumps in attempt to
escape the explosion.  The eye also has blinking animations and always attempts to look in the direction of the person.
